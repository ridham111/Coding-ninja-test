# Todo List App

This repository contains code for a simple Todo List web application. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks from their to-do list. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Filter tasks based on their completion status (all tasks, uncompleted tasks, completed tasks).
- Clear completed tasks with a single button click.

## Getting Started

To run this app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The application will load, and you can start adding tasks to your to-do list.

## How to Use

1. Enter a task in the input box at the top of the page.
2. Click the "Add" button or press the "Enter" key to add the task to your to-do list.
3. To mark a task as completed, check the checkbox next to the task. Completed tasks will be shown with a strike-through.
4. To delete a task, click the delete button (trash icon) next to the task.
5. Use the filter dropdown to view all tasks, uncompleted tasks, or completed tasks.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the Todo List app.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the app's functionality.

## How the App Works

The app uses vanilla JavaScript to handle user interactions and update the DOM accordingly. Each task is represented as a list item (`<li>`) containing a checkbox, label (task text), and delete button. The JavaScript code dynamically creates these elements when a new task is added.

## External Libraries Used

The app utilizes the following external libraries:

- Font Awesome (version 6.0.0-beta3): Provides icons for the delete button and checkbox.

## Compatibility

The app has been tested and verified to work on modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
